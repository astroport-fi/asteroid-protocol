# Asteroid Protocol

*A reference implementation for inscribing arbitrary data on a Cosmos SDK blockchain.*

With the Asteroid Protocol, anyone can permanently publish content directly onto the Cosmos Hub blockchain where it will live on in perpetuity. Developed in collaboration between Delphi Labs and the Astroport Foundation, the framework brings inscriptions and fungible tokens to Cosmos Hub, the world’s largest Cosmos blockchain by market cap, and a chain that doesn’t natively support tokens or smart contracts by design. 

The Asteroid Protocol brings additional functionality to Cosmos Hub with this open source framework that includes an Asteroid indexer, explorer, API, Cosmos Fungible Token (CFT-20) specification, a token deployer and minting tool, and front-end/back-end software. With the deployment of these tools, anyone can now connect their Keplr wallet and begin inscribing data, images and text and/or deploying, minting or swapping CFT-20 tokens — including the world’s first CFT-20, ROIDS — now at [asteroidprotocol.io](https://asteroidprotocol.io/).

As a metaprotocol framework, Asteroids are substantially more powerful than alternative approaches, which have largely relied on Cosmos SDK's "memo" field and do not support metaprotocol-like functionality or larger files up to ~550kb.
