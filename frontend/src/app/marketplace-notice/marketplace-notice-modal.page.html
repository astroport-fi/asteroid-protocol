            Buying tokens on the Asteroid marketplace requires 2 transactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, you must click the Reserve button on a specific listing and
            submit a nominal deposit fee. Once your reservation is confirmed,
            you'll have 100 blocks (~10 minutes) to click the Buy button and
            send the full purchase amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do not complete your purchase within 100 blocks, your
            reservation will be cancelled, and other traders will be able to
            initiate the buying process on that listing.

          if another user's deposit arrives seconds before yours; or 2) you
          successfully reserve a listing but do not finalize the purchase by
          sending the full amount within 100 blocks.
